## Need to Know Commands

+ pwd: Prints Working Directory > what is the path for where you are currently working

+ ls: Lists the files in the current directory
+ cd: Change Directory
+ mkdir: Makes a new directory or subdirectory
+ touch: Accesses/Touches/Modify

### For Example:

+ **cd projects** > would change the directory we are in to 'projects'
+ **mkdir new-project** > would create a new subdirectory called 'new-project' with in 'projects'
+ **touch new-project/newfile.md** > would create a markdown file called newfile if it does not already exist within new-project
+ **cd ..** > would take us back to the parent directory 'projects'
+ **ls projects/new-project** > would list the files in the sub directory 'new-project'
