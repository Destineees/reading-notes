## Growth Mindset

A growth mindset is to me remaining in the mindset of a young innocent child. Embracing challenges as learning opportunities. When I think of people who exhibit a growth mindset they are curious, confident, and constantly learning something new. I think we all are born with a growth mindset, yet the systems of the world often can leave us feeling as if things are fixed.

### Three ways to cultivate a growth mindset:

1. It is ok to walk away- step back from the problem
2. Welcome criticism and feedback
3. Seek new perspectives

 Uphill by Jemele Hill is one of my favorite memoirs. Jemele exhibits a growth mindset in her youth and early adult life and shares her stories of obstacles, challenges, and triumphs to inspire success in others. Highly reccommended read.
