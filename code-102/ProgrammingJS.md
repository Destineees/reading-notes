# Programming with Javascript

## MDN Control Flow

+ control flow is the order in which code is executed
+ the natural flow is from the first line to last line
+ functions and loops change the order code is executed from first to last line

## Functions

+ a set of statements that perform a task or calculates a value
+ there is some input and it returns some output
+ are defined with a declaration statement
+ declaration includes: name of function, list of parameters(enclosed in parenthesis), statements defining the function {enclosed in brackets}
+ calling(invoking) functions actually performs the actions specified in the parameters
+ Recursive functions call themselves

## Operators

+ assignment operators assign values to left operand based on the value of the right operand ==
+ a comparison operator compares its operands and returnsa a logical value based on whether the comparison is true
+ arithmetic operators take numerical values as operands and returns a single numerical value + - * / %
+ bitwise operators treats operands as a set of 32 bits AND OR XOR NOT
+ logical operators are used with boolean values && || !
+ comma operator evaluates both operands and returns the value of the last operand primarily used in for loops

## Expressions

+ a valid unit of code that resolves to a value
+ two types evaluative and assignment
+ include operators, operands, and a return value
