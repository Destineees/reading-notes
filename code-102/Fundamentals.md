# Operators, Loops, and The Fundamentals

## Expressions

Expressions are a valid unit of code that include operators, operands, and a return value.

## Comparison

+ looks at both values on either side of the operand and returns a logical value
+ operands can be numerical, string, logical, or objects
+ Equal, not equal, greater than, less than are just a few comparison operators

## Assignment

+ the = operator is used to assign values to variables or in other expressions
+ it assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of the operand on the right
+ when used with the + as in '+=' it becomes the addition assignment which will add the operand from the left to the operand on the right and assign the value to the operand on the left
+ '+-' will act similarly to the addition assignment only it will subtract before assigning the new value
+ there are also multiplication and division assignment operators

## Loops

Loops let run code over and over and over until you or the user or the computer says stop.

+ For Loops

a. repeats until a condition is false
b. for(initialization; condition; afterthought)
    statement

+ While Loops

a. executes as long as a condition is true
b. while(condition)
    statement
