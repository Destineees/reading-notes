# What is Javascript?

+ lightweight complied programming language
+ supports object oriented, impearative, and declarative styles
+ external files or internal with (< script> < /script>)
+ can provide output using alert, document.write, and console.log
+ receives input using prompt, or confirm

## Variables in Javascript

+ Declare a variable using var, let, const, or nothing
+ Variables store data values
+ A declared variable has no value until value is assigned
+ Good practice is to declare all variables at the beginning of a script

## Basic output

+ Alert will show a pop-up with text for the user to view the output
+ Document.write will change the content of a page
+ prints out warnings and errors generated by execution of javascript

## Input with prompt and confirm

+ Prompt is like alert and will show a pop up with text for the user to view and respond
+ Confirm isn't really input but rather will ask a yes or no question and pops up in the window
