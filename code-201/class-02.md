# Basics of HTML, CSS, and JS

HTML, CSS, and Javascript all play a critical role in the structure, design, and interactivity of a dynamic web page. We can use the three to present infromation to the world wide web in engaging and aesthetically pleasing ways. Today we will explore the basics as we build a fundamental foundation for software development.

## HTML

**Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?**

It is important to use semantic elements in our HTML because it supports SEO, Accessibilty, and proper element labeling.

**How many levels of headings are there in HTML?**

There is one main heading h1 and you can sub head five times for the six different heading elements in HTML.

**What are some uses for the <sup> and <sub> elements?**

+ When writing mathematical formulas or numbers with exponents we can use super script <sup>
+ When working with writing and footnotes we can use the subscript or <sub> element.

**When using the <abbr> element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?**

Both the title attribute and the expansion definition are needed to provide the full expansion of the term.

## CSS

**What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?**

+ External Stylesheet: separate file with .css extension

Traffic signals, controlling the switches for when the lights change could be solved using functions. We could also write a function to solve the problem for making simple decisions like a magic eight ball. 

An if statement checks a **condition** and if it evaluates to **be true**, then the code block will execute.

An else if will execute if the conditional is false and there is another condition to check for.
