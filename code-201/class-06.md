# Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

## Javascript Object Basics

+ How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?

An object is like the United States of America, it is one body with many different members. There are States, Cities, Territories which could be represented by the members of an object. A state can have different industries which could be represented by functions within the objects members.

+ What are some advantages to creating object literals?

Advantages of using an object literal are the ability to send related data in a structured manner; for example all the states have Senators and House Representatives these items can be written out in the creation of the object.

+ How do objects differ from arrays?

In an array items are sent individually and in an object the data items are sent as a package.

+ Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.

If the object property name is stored in a variable bracket notation is necessary.

+ Evaluate the code below. What does the term `this` refer to and what is the advantage to using `this`?

`this` refers to the dog object and the advantage of using `this` is it allows method definitions to transfer easily to other objects.

## DOM

+ What is the DOM?

The Document Object Model is an interface of web documents comprised of nodes and objects allowing programming languages to communicate with the page.

+ Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.

Javascript is used to modify and manipulate the DOM.
