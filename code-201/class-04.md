# Class 04 HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

These notes expand upon structuring web pages with HTML, styling with CSS and dynamic programming with JS functions.

## HTML Creating Hyperlinks

+ To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?
`<a>`
+ The href attribute contains what information?
The web address
+ What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?
Using descriptive link text, including keywords, and keep link text short.

## CSS Layout and Positioning

+ What is meant by “normal flow”?
 Normal flow refers to the box model
+ What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?
Block level fills the space and inline only uses the content space.
+ *Static* positioning is the default for every html element.

+ Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.
  Could be useful for background images, or for placing information that may hold alerts or updates, you can resize the element and make changes independent of other elements.

Fixed positioning is not relative to its nearest ancestor it is relative to the visible areas of the webpage.

## JS Functions
